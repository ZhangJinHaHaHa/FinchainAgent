Here's my detailed report:\n\n# Bitcoin and Ethereum Performance Analysis - Week of November 18-21, 2024\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced significant declines over the past week, with the broader cryptocurrency market entering what analysts are describing as a \"confirmed bear regime.\" The market has been characterized by substantial volatility and declining prices across major digital assets.\n\n## Bitcoin Performance Analysis\n\n### Current Price and Weekly Movement\n- **Current Price**: Approximately $85,739 - $87,038 (as of November 21, 2024)\n- **Weekly Decline**: Bitcoin has fallen 6-7% during the week\n- **Key Performance Metrics**:\n  - Trading below $100,000 level\n  - Experiencing significant outflows from Bitcoin ETFs\n  - Below 365-day moving average ($102,000), a technical indicator that has historically marked bear market transitions\n\n### Market Context\nBitcoin has been particularly affected by:\n- **ETF Outflows**: Bitcoin-investing ETFs reported massive outflows of approximately $870 million last Thursday, marking the second-largest withdrawal since their introduction in January 2024 [3]\n- **Bear Market Signals**: The cryptocurrency has been below its 365-day moving average since last Friday, a level that previously marked regime changes in the 2018 and 2021 bear markets [2]\n- **Macroeconomic Factors**: Continued declines are being fueled by broader macroeconomic concerns and investor retreat from riskier assets [1]\n\n## Ethereum Performance Analysis\n\n### Current Price and Weekly Movement\n- **Current Price**: Approximately $2,809 - $2,857 (as of November 21, 2024)\n- **Weekly Decline**: Ethereum has fallen 6-7% during the week\n- **Performance Relative to Bitcoin**: Ethereum has slightly underperformed Bitcoin, with declines of 7.67% compared to Bitcoin's 7.23% [2]\n\n### Market Position\nEthereum has been leading the broader crypto selloff alongside Bitcoin, with the two largest cryptocurrencies driving market sentiment downward [1].\n\n## Broader Market Context\n\n### Bear Market Confirmation\nAnalysts at 10x Research have confirmed that the crypto market has \"entered a confirmed bear regime,\" citing three key factors [3]:\n1. **Weakening ETF flows**\n2. **Continued selling by long-term holders**\n3. **Muted retail participation**\n\n### Market Sentiment\nThe current market environment is characterized by:\n- **Risk Aversion**: Investors appear to be pulling away from cryptocurrencies amid credit concerns and broader market uncertainty [1]\n- **Institutional Caution**: The rapid depreciation has triggered critical re-examination of positions in crypto-linked investments\n- **Technical Breakdown**: The failure to hold new highs from early October has continued the bear-market behavior [1]\n\n## Key Factors Driving the Decline\n\n### 1. Macroeconomic Pressures\n- Global economic uncertainty and credit concerns\n- Investor retreat from speculative assets\n- Broader risk-off sentiment in financial markets\n\n### 2. Institutional Behavior\n- Significant ETF outflows indicating institutional selling pressure\n- Long-term holder distribution\n- Reduced institutional appetite for crypto exposure\n\n### 3. Technical Factors\n- Breakdown below key moving averages\n- Failure to maintain support levels\n- Increased selling pressure from both retail and institutional participants\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\n### Short-term Prospects\nThe market appears to be in a confirmed downtrend, with analysts divided on whether this represents a temporary correction or the beginning of a more prolonged bear market. The critical technical level to watch is Bitcoin's ability to reclaim the $102,000 365-day moving average.\n\n### Investment Considerations\n- **Risk Management**: The current volatility underscores the importance of position sizing and risk management\n- **Long-term Perspective**: Despite short-term declines, some data shows Bitcoin buyers accumulating at record pace, with accumulator addresses purchasing over 375,000 BTC in 30 days [4]\n- **Market Maturation**: The presence of institutional products like ETFs provides additional market structure but also introduces new dynamics during downturns\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have faced significant headwinds over the past week, with the broader crypto market entering a confirmed bear regime. The combination of technical breakdowns, institutional outflows, and macroeconomic concerns has created a challenging environment for digital assets. Investors should monitor key technical levels and institutional flow data for signs of potential market stabilization or further deterioration.\n\n**Sources**: [1] Forbes Digital Assets, [2] Wall Street Journal, [3] Yahoo Finance, [4] Market analysis reports",
